Description: Sparse Composite Document Vector (SCDV) is a feature vector formation technique for documents
    to get distributional paragraph vector representations.
    In SCDV, word embedding's are clustered to capture multiple contexts in which words occur. 
    They are then chained together to form document topic-vectors that can express complex, multi-topic documents.
    The approach is described in more detail in the article by Dheeraj et al. (2016) <arXiv:1612.06778>.
